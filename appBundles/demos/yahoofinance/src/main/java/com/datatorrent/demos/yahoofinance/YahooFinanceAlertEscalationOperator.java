/*
* This operator accepts multiple ticker symbols for which potential alerts are to be raised.
* Once it gets a symbol, it checks the duration since the last alert was raised for this particular ticker.
* If the duration is more than what the alert interval is, then it will raise an alert. This is done for
* each specific ticker symbol.
*
* The functionality is similar to the AlertEscalationOperator, except that this operator can take multiple
* tickers and raise alerts for each one of them based on the time the last alert was raised for a particular symbol
* The AlertEscalationOperator does not consider the time elapsed since the last alert "for a particular ticker"
